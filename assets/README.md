Created an h1 and give it an id for the 5 days weather forecast, with three different cities and made them at the center of the page.

Then moved to create some icones where the data would be shown, for all the 5 days, and inserted an image  inside each icon just for the layout. 
For js 
Started with a function named GetInfo and gave it two different variables
Then I fetch the api and consol.log it 
With each day of the week.
